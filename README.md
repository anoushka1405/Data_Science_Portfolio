# Data_Science_Portfolio

## Project Description
This repository contains various data science practice files and mini-projects that I work on as I learn new concepts in data science. Each file demonstrates different techniques and tools, such as data wrangling, filtering, sorting, and data visualization. The repository will continue to grow as I add new work.

## Files
- `Video_Games_Filtering_Sorting.ipynb`: Filtering and sorting video game data based on different criteria.
- `Titanic Data - Operations on Series.ipynb`: Performing basic operations on series, while also plotting some graphs to draw conclusions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anoushka1405/data-science-practice.git
2.Install dependencies (if you have a requirements.txt file):
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Open the Jupyter Notebook

4.Open any of the notebooks and run the cells to view the results.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests with any new practice files, improvements, or suggestions.
