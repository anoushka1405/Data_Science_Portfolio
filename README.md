# Data_Science_Portfolio

## Project Description
This repository contains various data science practice files and mini-projects that I work on as I learn new concepts in data science. Each file demonstrates different techniques and tools, such as data wrangling, filtering, sorting, and data visualization. The repository will continue to grow as I add new work.

## Files
- `Video_Games_Filtering_Sorting.ipynb`: Filtering and sorting video game data based on different criteria like sales and year of release.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests with any new practice files, improvements, or suggestions.
